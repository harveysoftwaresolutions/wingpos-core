## What is wingpos?
 - Wingpos is a modular POS suite that is designed to be affordable (Heck, even free!) for small stores.
 - Non-free modules will be priced affordably, sold by every major software version.

## How to use
 - Wingpos will be designed to optimally work with docker. This will allow for easy crash recovery and cluster redundancy server side.
